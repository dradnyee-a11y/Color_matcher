                <h3>How to Use the Color Wheel and Color Palettes</h3>
                <p class="info_1">The color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic relationship. It is a useful tool for understanding color theory and creating harmonious color combinations.</p>

                <h4>Complementary Palette</h4>
                <ul class="info">
                    <li>Effect: Creates a strong contrast and vibrant look.</li>
                    <li>Use in real life: Great for highlighting important elements, like making a call-to-action button stand out, or combining clothing items for a bold statement.</li>
                    <li>Tip: Use one color as dominant and the other sparingly to avoid visual overload.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Analogous Palette</h4>
                <ul class="info">
                    <li>Effect: Produces a harmonious and calming feel because the colors are next to each other on the color wheel.</li>
                    <li>Use in real life: Ideal for outfits, interior design, or any project where you want a smooth, cohesive look.</li>
                    <li>Tip: Choose one color as dominant, the next as secondary, and the third as an accent.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Triadic Palette</h4>
                <ul class="info">
                    <li>Effect: Balances vibrancy and harmony. Triadic colors are evenly spaced on the color wheel.</li>
                    <li>Use in real life: Works well for colorful but balanced designs, like playful graphics, websites, or vibrant outfit combinations.</li>
                    <li>Tip: Stick to one dominant color and use the others in smaller amounts to avoid clashing.</li>
                </ul>
